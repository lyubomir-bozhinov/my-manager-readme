# Manager’s ReadMe  
*“A leader’s role is to bridge vision and execution, empower people to thrive, and adapt to the needs of the organisation — whether it’s a five-person start-up or a 50,000-person enterprise.”*

## 1. Introduction  

### **Purpose**  
This document outlines how I work, what I value, and what you can expect from me — and what I’ll expect in return. It’s here to:  
- Reduce ambiguity by setting clear expectations.  
- Encourage you to question, challenge, and contribute openly.  
- Share lessons from my journey in executive and hands-on engineering leadership.  

### **Who It’s For**  
Everyone in the organisation. This isn’t static: it will evolve with your feedback and as our team grows.  

### **What This Isn’t**  
- A contract or a rigid rulebook.  
- A substitute for open conversation.  
- Exhaustive; some things will only come to light as we work together.

## 2. My Role & Values  

### **How I Define Success**  
1. **Team Autonomy** – The team runs smoothly even when I’m not directly involved in every detail.  
2. **Reliable Delivery** – We consistently ship excellent work and meet deadlines without sacrificing quality.  
3. **Career Growth** – Supporting you in growing your career, even if it eventually takes you elsewhere.  

### **What I Value**  
- **Adaptability** – Good leadership shifts depending on context and scale.  
- **Empathy** – People first; processes follow.  
- **Ownership** – Everyone owns outcomes, not just tasks. If you spot a problem, flag it or fix it.  
- **Candour** – Speak up early and honestly. Disagree if needed. Alignment stems from clarity.
- **Efficiency** – Making the most of our time, resources, and workflows without compromising quality.

## 3. Communication & Availability  

### **How to Reach Me**  
- **Slack/Teams** – Best for quick, informal messages (I try to respond to non-urgent messages within an hour). Use ‼️ or 🚨 for urgent items (response time: asap).  
- **Email** – Ideal for longer updates or things that need a bit of thought.  
- **Calendar** – Please book (most) meetings in advance. Blockers or other urgent issues? Let me know, and we'll sort it out asap.

### **Working Hours & Flexibility**  
- **In-Office Days** – Our anchor days for planning and team time are flexible.  
- **Remote Work** – I fully trust you to manage your time. If you’re away for more than an hour during core working hours (10am–4pm), pop an “Out of Office” note in your calendar.  
- **After Hours** – No response expected. Don't check your Slack, unless you're on-call.

### **On-Call & Production Support**  
- **Rotation** – Each day, one team member keeps an eye on production support.  
- **What to Do** – Investigate issues, flag anything urgent. You’re not expected to fix everything immediately.  
- **Escalation** – Acknowledge alerts by replying. If something’s still unresolved by the end of the day, escalate it.

## 4. Team Workflow & Processes  

### **Planning & Sprints**  
- **Sprint Planning** – Held every other Monday. We focus on estimating well and delivering real value.  
- **Ticket Ownership** – Read every ticket carefully. If something’s unclear, raise a hand.  
- **If Estimates Go Wrong** – Raise it early. We aim to improve accuracy — not push through at all costs.  

### **Retrospectives**  
- We run these at the end of each sprint. Share what didn’t go well, but also suggest how we can fix or improve it.  

### **Feature Ownership**  
- **End to End** – Lead the full life-cycle of a feature: design, stakeholder buy-ins, delegation, launch, and iteration.  
- **After Launch** – Monitor adoption, gather feedback, and iterate.  

---

## 5. Decision-Making  
- **Default Mode** – Decisions should sit with those closest to the work.  
- **When I Step In** – If things are blocked, misaligned, or affect the wider organisation.  
- **How We Decide**  
  - Collaboratively.
  - Use data where we can.  
  - Run small experiments over debating hypotheticals.  
  - Choose simple, reversible paths when possible.

---

## 6. Feedback & Growth  

### **1:1s**  
- **Weekly**, 30 minutes. You set the agenda (please share it the day before).  
- **Focus Areas**:  
  - Career growth and skills development.  
  - Blockers or team dynamics.  
  - Priorities and direction.  
- I’m also keen to hear how I can improve: share feedback however works best for you (1:1s, DMs, email, or anonymously).  

### **Career Development**  
- We’ll check in on your career path every quarter - or at least biannually. I’ll help you find opportunities that align with your goals, even if that means looking outside your current team.  

### **Initiative Ownership**  
- If something bothers you or slows you down, take the lead: log it, flag it, or suggest a change. We’ll prioritise from there.  

---

## 7. Culture & Collaboration  

### **Keeping Stakeholders Informed**  
- Keep all concerned parties in the loop (e.g., PMs, QA, and Design). Weekly written updates are helpful and encouraged. If that feels too much, a quick Slack message also works.  

### **Resolving Conflict**  
- Go direct, be respectful. If you’re stuck, I’m happy to step in to mediate and support.  

### **Accountability**  
- If you’re blocked, raise it early. If something goes wrong, own it and propose a way forward.  

---

## 8. How I Work  

### **Style & Preferences**  
- Big-picture thinking, decisive action, and honest feedback.  
- I’m energised by helping people grow, untangling complex problems, and building systems that last.  

### **Availability & Boundaries**  
- I’ll respond quickly during working hours. Outside work, I try to switch off, and I encourage you to do the same.  

### **What Keeps Me Going**  
- Coaching new leaders  
- Untangling ambiguous problems  
- Building systems that last  
- Outside of work: Travelling (sometimes), reading (often), and exploring green spaces with my family

### **Final Thought**  
This isn’t meant to be perfect or complete. It’s a starting point—something we’ll shape together as we go. If anything here doesn’t sit right, please say so. I’m always open to the conversation.  

*Thanks for taking the time to read this. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.*
