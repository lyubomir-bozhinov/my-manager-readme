# Manager’s ReadMe  
*“A leader’s role is to bridge vision and execution, empower people to thrive, and adapt to the needs of the organisation — whether it’s a five-person start-up or a 50,000-person enterprise.”*

## 1. Introduction  

### **Purpose**  
This document outlines how I work, what I value, and what you can expect from me - and what I’ll expect in return. It’s here to:  
- Reduce ambiguity by setting clear expectations.  
- Encourage you to question, challenge, and contribute openly.  
- Share lessons from my journey in executive and hands-on engineering leadership.  

### **Who It’s For**  
Everyone in the organisation. This isn’t static: it will evolve with your feedback and as our team grows.  

### **What This Isn’t**  
- A contract or a rigid rulebook.  
- A substitute for open conversation.  
- Exhaustive; some things will only come to light as we work together.

## 2. My Role & Values  

### **How I Define Success**  
1. **Team Autonomy**: The team runs smoothly even when I’m not directly involved in every detail.  
2. **Reliable Delivery**: We consistently ship excellent work and meet deadlines without sacrificing quality.  
3. **Career Growth**: Supporting you in growing your career, even if it eventually takes you elsewhere.  

### **What I Value**  
- **Adaptability**: Good leadership shifts depending on context and scale.  
- **Empathy**: People first; processes follow.  
- **Ownership**: Everyone owns outcomes, not just tasks. If you spot a problem, flag it or fix it.  
- **Candour**: Speak up early and honestly. Disagree if needed. Alignment stems from clarity.  
- **Efficiency**: Making the most of our time, resources, and workflows without compromising quality.

## 3. Communication & Availability  

### **How to Reach Me**  
- **Slack/Teams**: Best for quick, informal messages (I aim to respond to non-urgent items within an hour). Use 🟡 for urgent matters (I’ll respond ASAP).  
- **Email**: Ideal for longer updates or requests requiring deeper thought.  
- **Calendar**: Please book most meetings in advance so I can prioritise and prepare. If you’re blocked or need urgent help, let me know—we’ll sort it out ASAP.  

### **Working Hours & Flexibility**  
- **In-Office Days**: Our anchor days for planning and team time are flexible (we'll define them togetherr).  
- **Remote Work**: I fully trust you to manage your time. If you’re away for more than an hour during core hours (10am–4pm), add an “Out of Office” note to your calendar.  
- **After Hours**: No response expected unless you’re on-call. Please avoid checking Slack/Teams outside work hours.  

### **On-Call & Production Support**  
- **Rotation**: Each day, one team member monitors production support.  
- **What to Do**: Investigate issues and flag urgency (e.g., respond with an emoji like 🟡 or 🚨). You’re not expected to fix everything immediately.  
- **Escalation**: Acknowledge alerts promptly. If unresolved by the end of the day, escalate with a ticket or message.

## 4. Team Workflow & Processes  

### **Planning & Sprints**  
- **Sprint Planning**: Held every other Monday. We focus on estimating well and delivering real value.  
- **Ticket Ownership**: Read every ticket carefully. If something’s unclear, raise it early.  
- **If Estimates Go Wrong**: Raise it early. We aim to improve accuracy, not push through at all costs.  

### **Retrospectives**  
- We run these at the end of each sprint. Share what didn’t go well, but also suggest how we can fix or improve it.  

### **Feature Ownership**  
- **End to End**: Lead the full life-cycle of a feature: design, stakeholder buy-ins, delegation, launch, and iteration.  
- **After Launch**: Monitor adoption, gather feedback, and iterate.  

---

## 5. Decision-Making  
- **Default Mode**: Decisions should sit with those closest to the work.  
- **When I Step In**: If things are blocked, misaligned, or affect the wider organisation.  
- **How We Decide**  
  - Collaboratively.  
  - Use data where we can.  
  - Run small experiments over debating hypotheticals.  
  - Choose simple, reversible paths when possible.  

---

## 6. Feedback & Growth  

### **1:1s**  
- **Weekly or Fortnightly**, 30 minutes. You lead the agenda (please share it the day before).  
- **Focus Areas**:  
  - Career growth and skills development.  
  - Blockers or team dynamics.  
  - Priorities and direction.  
- I’m also keen to hear how I can improve: share feedback however works best for you (1:1s, DMs, email, or anonymously).  

### **Career Development**  
- We’ll check in on your career path every quarter — or at least biannually. I’ll help you find opportunities that align with your goals, even if that means looking outside your current team.  

### **Initiative Ownership**  
- If something bothers you or slows you down, take the lead: log it, flag it, or suggest a change. We’ll prioritise from there.  

---

## 7. Culture & Collaboration  

### **Keeping Stakeholders Informed**  
- Keep all concerned parties in the loop (e.g., PMs, QA, and Design). Weekly written updates are helpful and encouraged. If that feels too much, a quick Slack message also works.  

### **Resolving Conflict**  
- Go direct, be respectful. If you’re stuck, I’m happy to step in to mediate and support.  

### **Accountability**  
- If you’re blocked, raise it early. If something goes wrong, own it and propose a way forward.  

---

## 8. How I Work  

### **Style & Preferences**  
- Big-picture thinking, decisive action, and honest feedback.  
- I’m energised by helping people grow, untangling complex problems, and building systems that last.  

### **Availability & Boundaries**  
- I’ll respond quickly during working hours. Outside work, I try to switch off, and I encourage you to do the same.  

### **What Keeps Me Going**  
- Coaching new leaders  
- Untangling ambiguous problems  
- Building robust systems  
- Outside of work: Travelling (sometimes), reading (often), and exploring green spaces with my family

### **Final Thoughts**  
This isn’t meant to be perfect or complete. It’s a starting point: something we’ll shape together as we go. If anything here doesn’t sit right, please say so. I’m always open to suggestions.  

*Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'd love to hear your thoughts.*
