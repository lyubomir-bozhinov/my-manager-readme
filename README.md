# Manager’s ReadMe  
*“A leader’s role is to bridge vision and execution, empower people to thrive, and adapt to the needs of the organisation - whether it’s a five-person start-up or a 50,000-person enterprise.”*

## 1. Introduction  

### **Purpose**  
This document outlines how I work, what I value, and what you can expect from me - and what I’ll expect in return. It’s here to:  
- Reduce ambiguity by setting clear expectations.  
- Encourage you to question, challenge, and contribute openly.  
- Share lessons from my journey in executive and hands-on engineering leadership.  

### **Who It’s For**  
Everyone in the organisation. This isn’t static: it will evolve with your feedback and as our team grows.  

### **What This Isn’t**  
- A contract or a rigid rulebook.  
- A substitute for open conversation.  
- Exhaustive; some things will only come to light as we work together.

## 2. My Role & Values  

### **How I Define Success**  
1. **Team Autonomy**: The team runs smoothly even when I’m not directly involved in every detail. This allows us to scale our impact and ensures everyone feels empowered.
2. **Reliable Delivery**: We consistently ship excellent work and meet deadlines without sacrificing quality. Our stakeholders depend on us, and consistent delivery builds trust and momentum.
3. **Career Growth**: Supporting you in growing your career, even if it eventually takes you elsewhere. Your individual growth fuels our collective success, and I believe in investing in your long-term journey.

### **What I Value**  
- **Adaptability**: Good leadership shifts depending on context and scale.  
- **Empathy**: People first; processes follow.  
- **Ownership\***: Everyone owns outcomes, not just tasks. If you spot a problem, fix it. Or at least raise it. 
- **Candour**: Speak up early and honestly. Disagree if needed. Alignment stems from clarity.  
- **Efficiency**: Making the most of our time, resources, and workflows - but never at the expense of quality.  

> *Ownership means being responsible for the result, not just your part in it. You don’t need to do everything yourself, but you follow through, raise risks, ask questions, and close the loop. It’s about being proactive and thinking in systems, not just deliverables.

## 3. Communication & Availability  

### **How to Reach Me**  
- **Slack/Teams**: Best for quick, informal messages (I aim to respond to non-urgent items within a reasonable time-frame). Use 🟡 for urgent matters (I’ll respond asap).  
- **Email**: Ideal for longer updates or requests requiring deeper thought.  
- **Calendar**: Please book most meetings in advance so I can prioritise and prepare. If you’re blocked or need urgent help, do let me know, and we’ll sort it out asap.  

### **Working Hours & Flexibility**  
- **In-Office Days**: Our anchor days for planning and team time are flexible (we'll define them together).  
- **Remote Work**: I fully trust you to manage your time. If you’re away for more than an hour during core hours (i.e., 10am–4pm), add an “Out of Office” note to your calendar.  
- **After Hours**: No response expected unless you’re on-call. I trust you to manage your work-life balance and strongly encourage you to disconnect and avoid checking Slack/Teams outside work hours to support your well-being.

### **On-Call & Production Support**  
- **Rotation**: Each day, one team member monitors production support.  
- **What to Do**: Investigate issues and flag urgency (e.g., respond with an emoji like 🟡 or 🚨). You’re not expected to fix everything immediately.
- **Escalation**: Acknowledge alerts promptly. If unresolved by the end of the day, escalate with a ticket or message.

## 4. Team Workflow & Processes  

### **Planning & Sprints**  
- **Sprint Planning**: Held every other Monday (if applicable). We focus on estimating well and delivering real value.  
- **Ticket Ownership**: Read every ticket carefully. If something’s unclear, raise it early.  
- **If Estimates Go Wrong**: Raise it early. We aim to improve accuracy, not push through at all costs.  

### **Retrospectives**  
- We run these at the end of each sprint/delivery cycle. Share what didn’t go well, but also suggest how we can fix or improve it.  

### **Feature Ownership**  
- **End to End**: Lead the full life-cycle of a feature: design, stakeholder buy-ins, delegation, launch, and iteration.  
- **After Launch**: Monitor adoption, gather feedback, and iterate with the goals of continuous improvement and feature evolution in mind.

## 5. Decision-Making  
- **Default Mode**: Decision-making power should reside with those closest to the work.  
- **When I Step In**: If things are blocked, misaligned, or affect the wider organisation.  
- **How We Decide**  
  - Collaboratively and resolutely, while always keeping an open mind.
  - We prioritize speed where appropriate, balancing thoroughness with the need for timely action.
  - Use data where we can, gather when absent. Intuition, but only if deeply informed.
  - Run small experiments/POCs over debating hypotheticals.
  - Choose simple, reversible paths when possible in line with Andy Grove’s idea of Revolving Doors.

---

## 6. Feedback & Growth  

### **1:1s**  
- **Weekly or Fortnightly**, 30 minutes. You lead the agenda (please share it the day before).  
- **Focus Areas**:  
  - Career growth and skills development.  
  - Blockers or team dynamics.  
  - Priorities and direction.  
- I’m also keen to hear how I can improve: share feedback however works best for you (1:1s, DMs, email, or anonymously).  

### **Mistakes Happen**
We’ll all make them, including me. What matters is how we respond. I value transparency, learning, and shared responsibility over blame. Let’s own it, fix it, and talk about what we learned. That’s how we build trust and get better - together.

### **Career Development**  
- We’ll check in on your career path every quarter - or at least biannually. I’ll help you find opportunities that align with your goals, even if that means looking outside your current team.  

### **Initiative Ownership**  
- If something bothers you or slows you down, take the lead: log it, flag it, or suggest a change. We’ll prioritise from there.  

---

## 7. Culture & Collaboration  

### **Keeping Stakeholders Informed**  
- Keep all concerned parties in the loop (e.g., PMs, QA, and Design). Weekly written updates are helpful and encouraged. If that feels too much, a quick Slack message also works.  

### **Resolving Conflict**  
- Go direct, be respectful. If you’re stuck, I’m happy to step in to mediate and support.  

### **Accountability**  
- If you’re blocked, raise it early. If something goes wrong, own it and propose a way forward.  

---

## 8. How I Work  

### **Style & Preferences**  
- Big-picture thinking, decisive action, and honest feedback.  
- I’m energised by helping people grow, untangling complex quandaries, and building systems that last - ultimately, to solve difficult, real problems for others.  

### **Availability & Boundaries**  
- I’ll respond quickly during working hours. Outside work, I try to switch off, and I encourage you to do the same. 

### **What Keeps Me Going**  
- Coaching new leaders  
- Untangling ambiguous real-world problems  
- Building robust systems  
- Outside of work: Travelling (sometimes), reading (often), and exploring green spaces with my family

### **Final Thoughts**  
This isn’t meant to be perfect or complete. It’s a starting point: something we’ll shape together as we go. If anything here doesn’t make sense, please say so. I’m always open to suggestions.

*Thanks for taking the time to read this. What's one thing you'd add or change to make this more helpful?*
